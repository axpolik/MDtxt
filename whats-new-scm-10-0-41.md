## <a name="enhancements"></a>Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they're only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2024wave1/finance-supply-chain/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

Some of these features aren't visible on your system until you turn them on in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) using the name listed here for the *Feature management name* (additional configuration may also be needed). Features that don't show a feature management name are visible by default as of this version of Supply Chain Management, but typically add a new configuration option that you need to set to use the new functionality.

| Feature enhancement | Description |
|---|---|
|<p>**Module:** Asset management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(Preview) Print work order document attachments*</p> | Lets you print work order reports that include PDF documents attached to work order headers and lines. |
|<p>**Module:** Inventory and warehouse management</p><p>**Feature management name:** *(Preview) Inventory dimensions with license plate id cleanup*</p> | Adds the ability to clean up inventory dimensions with license plate IDs that are more than one year old, are financial updated, and have no on-hand inventory. |
|<p>**Module:** Master planning</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Enable the calculation of Batch CTP even when plan run ends with errors.*</p> | Allows for CTP-confirmed dates to be calculated for sales order lines, even when the Planning Optimization run ends with errors. Confirmed dates will be calculated for sales order lines that didn't have any errors. To enable or disable this behavior, use the **Calculate Batch CTP even with errors** setting in the plan settings for the dynamic plan. |

You can control this behavior using the new **Consolidate sales orders for direct deliveries** setting on the **Delivery** tab of the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page. When you enable this feature, the system defaults to not consolidating qualifying sales orders, which is different from the previous behavior. Previously, the batch job always consolidated qualifying sales orders. |
|<p>**Module:** Procurement and sourcing</p><p>**Feature management name:** *Enable purch parameters to control delivery information sync on sales and purchase orders*</p> | Controls the creating and updating of the **Delivery mode** and **Delivery terms** fields on purchase orders.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.
